(a) 
beta_1 = r(sd_shoulder_height/sd_shoulder_girth) = 0.67(9.41/10.37) = 0.6079749
beta_0 = y_bar-beta_1(x_bar) = 171.14-(0.6079749)(108.20) = 105.357
y= 105.357 + 0.6079749(x)

(b) 
Slope: Every 1 cm increase in shoulder girth results in a average height increases of 0.6079749
Intercept: If you'd have 0cm shoulder width they'd be 105.357cm tall

(c) 
r=0.67 ==> r^2= 0.4489 so %44.89 of the model is explained by the shoulder girth.

(d) .
y= 105.357 + 0.6079749(100) = 166.154

(e) 
e=y_i-y_hat = 160 - (166.154) = -6.15449
There is a 6.15449 difference between the model prediction and what was measured.

(f) 
No, the data is based on adults. Children are not from the same population.

(a) 
There is positive correlation. As the height increases, the weight increases.

(b) 
y= (1.0176)x + (-105.0113)
Slope: Every 1 cm increase in height results in a average weight increase of 1.1076 kg.
Intercept: If you were 0cm in height, you'd weigh -105.011 which is obviously impossible.

(c)
Null hypothesis: Beta_1=0 
Alternate hypothesis: Beta_1â‰ 0 
P-value is given as 0.0000 (Beta is the slope)
Result is significant (increase in height is associated with increase in weight) because p-value is significantly low.

(d) 
r = 0.72 ==> r^2=(0.72)^2 = 0.5184 ==> The model explains 51.84% variability of the response data around its mean.
